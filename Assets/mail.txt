Hi Jamie,

since I finally got all the components last month, I've been working hard on our Glaucoma VR project and I'm excited to tell you that I'm almost done with a prototype!

So far, I've created an app for the XR-1 headset we purchased, that does the following:

- read patient data from file
- generate left and right eye masks based on that data
- apply them to the respective eye in the headset
- track eye data live and shift the mask based on eye movement
- use different means of filtering to alter vision based on the mask (blur, contrast-loss)

In principle, this app simulates how a patient diagnosed with Glaucoma would see the world. Because of the technology the headset offers, we have the unique opportunity to 'look through' the headset by using the AR capabilities and utilize eye-tracking to guarantee a simulation where one can't 'look around' the mask as it always moves with the gaze direction.

I talked with Kwan-Liu and we said it might be best to just present the current progress in the form of a video. Since I've never done video editing before I'll brush up on that and will send you a demo in the coming days (I hope latest by next Monday). :)

I also had an opportunity to closely read the paper you sent me earlier. I think it shows how relevant VR can be for Glaucoma diagnosis, which further backs up the goals in for our project. On the other hand, I think that our application is quite different, since we simulate Glaucoma, as opposed to diagnosing.

There are multiple directions we could take it from here, but I think it might be best to discuss these in a meeting after you had a chance to see the video.

I'll send you a link in the coming days and would be happy to schedule a meeting after that.

Thanks a lot for the collaboration so far and looking forward to meeting with you,
Lukas
